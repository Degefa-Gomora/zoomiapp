## Installation

To get ZOOMI up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/zoomi.git](https://github.com/your-username/zoomi.git)
    cd zoomi
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your environment variables.
        ```
        PORT=5000
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
        # Add any other API keys for video/audio services (e.g., WebRTC signaling server, Twilio, Agora, etc.)
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory for any client-side environment variables.
        ```
        REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
        # Add any client-side specific keys or configs
        ```

5.  **Run the database (if self-hosting MongoDB):**
    Ensure your MongoDB instance is running or connect to a cloud-hosted MongoDB service.
